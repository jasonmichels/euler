### Project Euler Testing
My different attempts and benchmarks for  Project Euler problems

### Testing
In order to run the calculations and benchmarks you need to "cd" into a directory, and run the go test command found below.

This will run the tests and benchmarks. If you want to see the calculated results, checkout the test suite.

```sh
$ go test -v ./... -bench . -cover
```
